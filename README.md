# intary
This Golang utility used in managing integer arrays and performing math operations on those integer arrays.

The primary library is located in the source file ./common/intary.go.

'intary.go' contains a structure named, 'IntAry'. This structure and 
provides methods for performing a variety of math operations on 'IntAry'
objects. 'IntAry' objects are capable of performing complex math operations
on very large numbers.

The directory ./archives/eulersnumbercalc contains an example which calculates
Euler's Number out to 1,000 digits.


### Source Code Repository
The source code repository for this library is located at:

https://github.com/MikeAustin71/intary.git


### Dependencies

The 'IntAry' object has the following dependency:

nthroot.go - Source Repository: https://github.com/MikeAustin71/mathhlpr.git


# numstrutility
Golang utility used in formatting and managing number strings.

# numstrdto
Golang Utility for managing number strings

# stringmathops

Contains data structures used in performing string and integer math
operations.

The primary structure and associated methods are contained in the source
code file, 'intary.go' located in the 'common' directory.

Data structures and methods of integer array management and math
operations are contained in the source code file 'intary.go'. 
The primary data structure is 'IntAry'. The structure 'IntAry' and
the associated methods necessary to perform a variety of math operations
on integer arrays and number strings.

'strmathop.go' contains methods which perform math operations using
multiple 'IntAry' objects.

Source code for 'intary.go' and 'strmathop.go' is maintained in repository:
https://github.com/MikeAustin71/stringmathops.git

### Dependencies
IntAry located in source code file, 'intary.go'. It is dependent on
structure 'NthRootOp' located in source code file, 'nthroot.go'
